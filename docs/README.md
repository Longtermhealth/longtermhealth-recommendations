### For Developers
1. Start with [Docker Setup](setup/DOCKER_LOCAL_SETUP.md)
2. Understand the [Routine Model](architecture/ROUTINE_MODEL.md)
3. Learn the [Filter Service](algorithms/FILTER_SERVICE.md)

### For Operations
1. Review [Deployment Guide](deployment/DEPLOYMENT.md)
2. Check [API Reference](api/API_REFERENCE.md)
3. Monitor with [Analytics](architecture/ANALYTICS.md)
